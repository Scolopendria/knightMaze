It takes around 80µs to find the first solution, regardless of the starting square.
After that, it takes on average 8µs to find the next solution. Theoretically, the program
should take longer and longer to find more solutions as the the program starts searching the
broader search space for unlikely solutions.

At one second:
Starting square:        Solutions found:
        0                   201k
        10                  292k
        35                  102k
        45                  38.1k

After some optimizations, such as using 'unsigned char' instead of 'int', it takes
around 50µs (60% faster) to find the first solution.(All following stats assume with optimizations)
